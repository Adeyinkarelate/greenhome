                            There are different types of window blinds like the roller blinds, PVC, Day & Night, Romans, Mat, wooden, vertical fabrics and the Venetians. Their operations or mechanisms are simple either a horizontal or vertical motion which can be simultaneous or spontaneous. These are window coverings that serve as complete or semi blackouts or both from the sun on the living rooms, bedrooms, lounge, or work places while maintaining high degree of privacy and as well insulation during hot or cold weather periods. The Vertical fabrics or PVC opens by rotation but glides horizontally towards left or right of the window while the Venetians open by a shutter movement but compressibly move towards the upper frames of the windows. The day and Night, Romans and roller blinds rolls up in sliding or gliding motion. The wooden Venetians comes in 50 – 55mm or in smaller diameters like 25 – 30mm slats while the opposite vertical wooden blinds have wider blades/slats. The wooden slats/blades are naturally textured highly polished treated wood in their natural colours like the peach, oak, pine, beige, Mahogany, Terakota – like the corals or animal skin designed to create a natural ambience for every lifestyle which is mostly for luxurious and elegant lifestyles. The metallic venetian blinds are similar to that of wooden blinds in shapes, sizes and formation aside their material constituents. Blinds and slides have some edge over other window coverings in that they protect you from excessive ultra violet rays of the sun. They insulate during cold or hot weathers and ventilate the rooms or workplaces at extreme high temperatures and humidity.

                            magnificent designs. We combine high quality materials that are eco-friendly into moulds to form ceilings, pillars and
                            beams of immense structure and value that stands the taste of time. Cracks and holes made by tools and nails are very
                            repulsive to look at infact it makes the rooms appear very boring but our knowledge application through experience and
                            expertise treatments to the walls reverses these ugly trend making your homes, halls and workplaces come alive.
